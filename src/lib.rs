//! `ksq` is an implementation of a K2 tree (kÂ²-tree), which, when storing
//! sparse bits, is a very space-effective matrix. This library implements
//! the tree as a flat 1-d array, rather than explicitly encoding
//! dimensionality.
//!
//! Unlike some other k2 trees, I've opted to use a `u16`, not a `u8`. This
//! means that the tree will grow by `N<<4` each layer -- and each cell can
//! represent a maximum of 16 other cells, not 8.
